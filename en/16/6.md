द्वौ भूतसर्गौ लोकेऽस्मिन्दैव आसुर एव च ।  
दैवो विस्तरशः प्रोक्त आसुरं पार्थ मे शृणु ॥६॥

dvau bhūta-sargau loke 'smin  
daiva āsura eva ca  
daivo vistaraśaḥ prokta  
āsuraḿ pārtha me śṛṇu



### Translation:

**O son of Pritha, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the other demoniac. I have already explained to you at length the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac.**

### Purport:

Lord Krishna, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the Prajapati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not.
