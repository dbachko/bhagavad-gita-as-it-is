सुखं त्विदानीं त्रिविधं शृणु मे भरतर्षभ ।  
अभ्यासाद्रमते यत्र दुःखान्तं च निगच्छति ॥३६॥

sukhaḿ tv idānīḿ tri-vidhaḿ  
śṛṇu me bharatarṣabha  
abhyāsād ramate yatra  
duḥkhāntaḿ ca nigacchati



### Translation:

**O best of the Bharatas, now please hear from Me about the three kinds of happiness by which the conditioned soul enjoys, and by which he sometimes comes to the end of all distress.**

### Purport:

A conditioned soul tries to enjoy material happiness again and again. Thus he chews the chewed. But sometimes, in the course of such enjoyment, he becomes relieved from material entanglement by association with a great soul. In other words, a conditioned soul is always engaged in some type of sense gratification, but when he understands by good association that it is only a repetition of the same thing, and he is awakened to his real Krishna consciousness, he is sometimes relieved from such repetitive so-called happiness.
