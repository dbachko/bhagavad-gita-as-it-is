सिद्धिं प्राप्तो यथा ब्रह्म तथाप्नोति निबोध मे ।  
समासेनैव कौन्तेय निष्ठा ज्ञानस्य या परा ॥५०॥

siddhiḿ prāpto yathā brahma  
tathāpnoti nibodha me  
samāsenaiva kaunteya  
niṣṭhā jñānasya yā parā



### Translation:

**O son of Kunti, learn from Me how one who has achieved this perfection can attain to the supreme perfectional stage, Brahman, the stage of highest knowledge, by acting in the way I shall now summarize.**

### Purport:

The Lord describes for Arjuna how one can achieve the highest perfectional stage simply by being engaged in his occupational duty, performing that duty for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One attains the supreme stage of Brahman simply by renouncing the result of his work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. That is the process of self-realization. The actual perfection of knowledge is in attaining pure Krishna consciousness; that is described in the following verses.
